# App Counter

Welcome dear reviewer! This very simple app contains 3 counters and buttons to add and substract numbers every time the buttons are hit. It also displays a total number that represents the sum of all the counters.

Built with JavaScript, Typescript and Jest for testing.

## Setup
Run `npm install`, then run `npm start` to start the application and `npm test` to run the tests.
